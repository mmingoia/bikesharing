# City Bike Sharing Analysis (UT DA Module 14)

UT DA Module 14

## Challenge Write up

### Project Overview

The goal of this analysis is to check the feasibility of starting a shared bike program in Des Moines, Iowa.  The primary question that I choose to analyse was "What is the population of Des Moines? How does its population compare to the population of New York City? Does the population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program?" In order to evaluate those questions I added census data and annual tourist data from both NYC and Des Moines into the tableau workbook that was created from the Citi Bike data that was provided for the lesson.

### Slide Discussion

In the first slide "NYC Citi Bike Overview" is a basic overview showing Peak hours, the number of rides during a month and where the rides originated from was created in order to show what a successful bike sharing program will look like.

The next slide "NYC City Bike Rider Analysis" shows some key statistics of the types or riders that use the bikes in NYC. This analysis indicates that the most common customer is a Male between 18 and 65 years of age.  It also shows that the majority of customers subscribe to the bike sharing program.  This indicates that creating a solid subscriber base is a key to launching the business successfully.

The third slide "NYC and Des Moines Population Comparison" shows the gender breakdown as well as the total population and population density of both NYC and Des Moines.  NYC has a male population percentage of 48%, compared to 49% of Des Moines.  Those percentages are close, but Des Moines does have a slightly higher male population percentage. NYC has a much higher total population of over 8 million people compared to just over 200,000 people in Des Moines. IT also has a significantly higher population density of 27,547 per square mile, compared to 2,649 per square mile in Des Moines. This indicated that you will need significantly less bikes in Des Moines than NYC.

The next slide "NYC and Des Moines Tourist Comparison" was created in order to factor in tourists that are not included in the population, but will also be potential users of the bikes.  Approximately 65.2 million people visit NYC every year compared to 13.7 million visitors to Des Moines.  However due to the smaller size of Des Moines the average tourist per day in Des Moines of 464 is much closer to the 590 tourists per day in NYC than the total tourist visitors.

The final slide "NYC and Des Moines Age Comparison" was created to compare the age brackets of the most common user of the bikes in NYC.  The most common user is between 18 and 65 years of age.  In NYC that is 65% of the population compared to 64% in Des Moines.  These percentages are very close and indicate the age bracket that includes the most common users of the bike sharing program is similar between NYC and Des Moines.

### Conclusion and Dashboard Link

In conclusion, based on the available data it appears that a Bike Sharing program is a viable business opportunity in Des Moines, Iowa. The general population is smaller and not as dense as NYC, but the average age of users in both cities is similar.  I addition there are significant tourists that visit Des Moines every year that will be an additional source of riders.  The number of bikes needed will of course be significantly smaller than the bikes needed in NYC due to the smaller population and population density.  The link below is the dashboard that was created for this analysis.
